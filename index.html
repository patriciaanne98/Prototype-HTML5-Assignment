      <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    
      <h3>Feedback Received</h3>
      <p>
        When I first built the Mars Rover project, I asked a peer to review it. They mentioned that while the layout was good, the navigation on mobile felt a little clunky, the homepage lacked visual excitement, and that adding more interactive elements could make it more engaging. Based on their feedback, I decided to completely improve the site's structure, design, and usability.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Revisions Made</h3>
      <p>
        To address the feedback, I redesigned the Mars Rover project with a modern, clean layout, added a dark mode toggle for accessibility, and included high-quality NASA images. I also improved the mobile experience by adding a responsive hamburger menu. Hover animations and better FAQ interactions were added to make the site more dynamic and fun.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Did Well</h3>
      <p>
        I stayed consistent with clean design standards, organized my files carefully, and focused on responsive behavior. I also practiced semantic HTML and accessible design patterns throughout the project.
      </p>
    
      <h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
      <p>
        If I could start over, I would plan even more detailed wireframes at the beginning and spend more time on small animations and image optimizations. I also learned the importance of testing on mobile much earlier in the design process.
      </p>
    
      <h3>Overall Learning Experience</h3>
      <p>
        This project taught me the full process of building a site ‚Äî from early structure planning, to design, coding, revisions, and final publishing. I now feel much more confident building professional, accessible, and user-centered websites.

    <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Mars Rover website project was a major learning experience for me this semester. My goal was to create an educational and interactive platform that highlights NASA's robotic explorers on Mars. The original version included basic structure, images, and content about the rovers. While it functioned, it lacked visual polish, responsiveness, and user interactivity, which limited the overall experience.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Revisions and Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      After receiving feedback, I redesigned the Mars Rover site with a stronger focus on clean UI, mobile-first responsiveness, and user engagement. I introduced a dark mode toggle for accessibility, enhanced the homepage with high-quality images and animations, and added a responsive hamburger menu to improve mobile navigation.
I also redesigned the FAQ section to make it more dynamic, added subtle hover effects for interactivity, and cleaned up my file organization for easier maintenance.

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me the full workflow of web development ‚Äî from early wireframing to coding, user feedback, and iterative improvements.
I learned the importance of planning for mobile responsiveness from the beginning, designing with accessibility in mind, and keeping file structure organized for larger projects.
If I could start over, I would spend more time prototyping and testing animations earlier in the design process to make future revisions smoother.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Revising the Mars Rover project made me realize how important progressive enhancement and user-centered design are for building professional websites. I'm proud of the improvements I made, and this experience gave me the confidence to approach future web design projects with a stronger design and development process.
