      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>
        Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites that starts with the most important part‚Äîthe content‚Äîand then adds design and extra features on top. Think of it like a Peanut M&M: the peanut is the content (basic info), the chocolate is the design (CSS), and the candy shell is the fancy stuff like animations and interactive elements (JavaScript).
      </p>

      <p>This idea is different from something called graceful degradation, which starts with a fancy website and tries to make it still work (kind of okay) on older devices. Progressive enhancement does the opposite‚Äîit makes sure everyone can access the content, no matter what device or browser they‚Äôre using, and then adds the cool stuff for people with newer tech.</p>

      <p>Progressive enhancement is important today because people use all kinds of phones, tablets, and computers to visit websites. Some may have slow internet or limited features. With this method, you make sure everyone gets a good experience, even if it‚Äôs a simple one.</p>
      <p>
        Here's a good article I found that explains more about progressive enhancement:

    <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Mars Rover website project was a major learning experience for me this semester. My goal was to create an educational and interactive platform that highlights NASA's robotic explorers on Mars. The original version included basic structure, images, and content about the rovers. While it functioned, it lacked visual polish, responsiveness, and user interactivity, which limited the overall experience.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Revisions and Improvements</h3>
    <p>
      After receiving feedback, I redesigned the Mars Rover site with a stronger focus on clean UI, mobile-first responsiveness, and user engagement. I introduced a dark mode toggle for accessibility, enhanced the homepage with high-quality images and animations, and added a responsive hamburger menu to improve mobile navigation.
I also redesigned the FAQ section to make it more dynamic, added subtle hover effects for interactivity, and cleaned up my file organization for easier maintenance.
You can view the updated project here:

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me the full workflow of web development ‚Äî from early wireframing to coding, user feedback, and iterative improvements.
I learned the importance of planning for mobile responsiveness from the beginning, designing with accessibility in mind, and keeping file structure organized for larger projects.
If I could start over, I would spend more time prototyping and testing animations earlier in the design process to make future revisions smoother.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      Revising the Mars Rover project made me realize how important progressive enhancement and user-centered design are for building professional websites. I'm proud of the improvements I made, and this experience gave me the confidence to approach future web design projects with a stronger design and development process.
